# Project Euler in Elixir

Some of Project Euler's exercises implemented in Elixir,
with the goal of getting better at the language.

The problems are not solved in the most
efficient/concise/beautiful/idiomatic way possible,
but rather in a way that explores the different features of the language.

## Running
- Fire up `iex` in the `src` directory
- Load the Euler file you want to run with `c("number-of-problem.exs")`
- Modules are Named `EulerXX`, where `XX` is the number of the exercise
- Run `EulerXX.run`
